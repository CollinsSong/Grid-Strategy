# Grid-Strategy
XJTLU Final Year Project

## codes:

The main codes of this FYP is Grid Strategy testing.

## The other three codes are the products during the process of this project:

"Bitcoin exchange simulation" is a real time market data collecting/ trading simulation with a built in simple(testing) algorithm. The final algorithm is not tested by this program.This program now can not get real time data since Chinese government has forbidened the trading of Bitcoin. So the data it showing is the data from the last minute of the policy (no more updates from the company).  

"OKCoin API for collecting market data" is used to collect real-time market data (no more updates from company, same reason).

"graph plotting" is the graph plotting program.

## data:

"2014-2016 BTC USD" is the data I used to test this algorithm.This is not collected by me, I download it from website. 

"day_data" is the daily data from 2014 to 2018. This is also downloaded from website. The day data on algorithm designing is obtained from this file.
